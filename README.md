# Glisser Front End Test

The purpose of this test is to grasp your understanding of client side development by building a rapid front end application (preferably in Angular).

## Objective

![alt text](https://github.com/Ferie/Glisser/blob/master/src/assets/images/CaptureGlis1.PNG "Requirement 1")

- When clicking on the username, the following modal should be displayed

![alt text](https://github.com/Ferie/Glisser/blob/master/src/assets/images/CaptureGlis2.PNG "Requirement 2")

- Similarly, when clicking on the bio

![alt text](https://github.com/Ferie/Glisser/blob/master/src/assets/images/CaptureGlis3.PNG "Requirement 3")

- Both modals should disregard the current edits if pressing the ‘X’ button and save
current edits if ‘OK’ is pressed.
- No need to persist the data to any kind of backend/database.
- You don’t need to implement anything related to the profile picture.
- You will be evaluated on your ability to build and reuse components.
- You can provide your answer in any way you prefer (JsFiddle, repo).
- Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

Thank you for participating!
